Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on getting a Jetbrains educational license, which requires me to get Github educational benefits; to get Github educational benefits, I need to populate my account with a variety of things, such as this README.

I have also made a file in the self-titled repository GitHub prompted me to make called "How-To-GitHub", where I write notes about how to do various GitHub and programming things so I don't forget them. It is intended to be a purely personal resource, but if anyone else finds it helpful, feel free to reference it as needed.
